A persistent layout component is one that wraps the root of your site, so it's not affected by page changes. It will only mount once, and never unmount. I you were to have a video component keep playing between page changes, you would add that to the persistent layout component. To add a persistent layout use wrapRootElement: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/#wrapRootElement
