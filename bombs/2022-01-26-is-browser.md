Does it work with a hard coded url? A test to see if its a data layer problem, or a react-stl-viewer problem.
Tobias Kietzmann â€” Today at 1:26 PM

tried it already
in debug both are working

Then its the react-stl-viewer i guess.
Try to do
window ? <StlViewer
            style={style}
            orbitControls
            shadows
            url={url}
        /> : null

"window" is not available during server side rendering.

            style={style}
            orbitControls
            shadows
            url={url}

this works! fantastic, thanks!
now i have to read whats happening there ðŸ˜„ im coming from app development and i'm not very familar with web dev righti now

This is a little bit "hacky", but the easy way to solve it that is very common.
StlViewer is trying to access window, or document, or something that is not available when the page is rendered on the server.
