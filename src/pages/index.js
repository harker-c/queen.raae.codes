        <h3>Dates</h3>
        <p>
          Summer Functions runs from <strong>Saturday, July 17th</strong> to{" "}
          <strong>Friday, August 27th</strong>, with a week's break between the
          third and fourth challenges to let you relax or catch up before the

        <p>
          You can add the Gatsby Serverless Functions to you existing Gatsby
          site&nbsp;(>=3.7), use our starter Gatsby site or create an API only

        </p>

        <h3>Forum</h3>
        <p>
          The Discussions tab of the private GitHub repo will be our forum.
          There you you can ask questions, discuss possible solutions and get to
          know the other cats, sailors and sea dogs.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Each Saturday you'll receive the challenge in your inbox. In addition
          you will be able to find it as a thread in the forum.
        </p>

        <h3>Live Webinars</h3>
        <p>
          Each Tuesday Queen Raae we'll walk you through a possible solution to
          the challenge as a live webinar where you can ask questions. The
          webinar recordings will be available to view, at your convenience,
          until the end of the year.

        <h3>Code Samples</h3>
        <p>
          The live webinar code will be available as a Pull Request in the
          private GitHub repo. Feel free to comment and ask questions directly
          on the Pull Request.
        </p>

        <h3>Group Code Review</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a sailor or sea dog you are invited to join the group code
          review every Wednesday. There you will get feedback on your code from
          Queen Raae and others in the group of max 8 people.
