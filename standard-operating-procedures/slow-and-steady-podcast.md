Hello <name>, 

We are super excited to be chatting with you on <day>, check the calendar for the time in your timezone.

We'll meet at <link>. Link should also be in the calendar event.

Every week we select a feeling, and talk a little bit about the week as related to the feeling. 
We keep that in for the guest episodes as well, as an introduction to your week.
If you need help naming your feelings check out this handy feelings wheel: https://feelingswheel.com/.

We'll try to keep it conversational style, and you should be prepared to talk about: 
- What problem does <product> solve?
- How long have you been at it with <product>?
- How did you get the idea?
- Is this your first product?
- What does a typical week look like?
- Is it a full time thing / part time thing / side project?
- What do the numbers look like? Revenue/users etc. if you are willing to share
- What are your short term and long term goals/plans for <product>?
- Where can people find out more about you?

See you soon,
Benedicte
