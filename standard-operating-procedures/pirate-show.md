--- Practical ---

We stream on StreamYard, no login needed - just head on over to <stream link> 5-10 minutes before the hour.

It's usually pretty chaotic on our end for those minutes, as we prep the family to go live 🤪

If you want more information, they have a guest help article you may read: https://support.streamyard.com/hc/articles/360043291612.

We also recommend you open the stream on YouTube <youtube link> in a seperate and MUTED tab so you can participate in the chat if/when needed.

There is a private chat in Streamyard if you want to tell us something while streaming, or need to send us links to open.
