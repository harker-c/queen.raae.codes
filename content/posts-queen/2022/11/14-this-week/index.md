I'll let you know when the talk is out on YouTube, or you may catch it live at [Modern Frontends this week](https://www.modernfrontends.live/) Friday at 17:30 CET ([view time in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/62b3742f)). There is a [virtual pass option](https://securecheckout.modernfrontends.live/tw).

Lots have happened around the Gatsby islands:

- [Valhalla Content Hub](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/valhalla-content-hub) by Gatsby — the Gatsby Data Layer as an independent product you can bring your own framework to
- [Gatsby v5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-5/) is out of beta — who's excited about Slices and Partial Hydration?

The Gatsby team members I met at JamstackConf seemed pretty stoked with the announcements 🥳
