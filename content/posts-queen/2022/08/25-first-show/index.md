Friendly reminder that we are back today with our [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts](https://www.youtube.com/QueenRaae/live) in the sharky waters around the Gatsby island.

Onboarding the ship this season are great folks like Colby Fayock (Astrocoder & Developer Advocate), Josh Johnson (Engineer at Gatsby), and more.

- Make sure to sign up for [reminder emails](/emails/reminders/) sent 30 minutes before we go live so you don't miss out 📬

We will source these little avatars on today's show from a Supabase table into the Gatsby Data Layer to make them statically generated! At the moment, these are fetched client side.

Hope to see you there,  
Queen Raae
