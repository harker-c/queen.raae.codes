Over the years, I followed way too many people on Twitter, so many that I was actually not allowed to follow any more. There seems to be a magical 5000 limit.

I have been toying with the idea of making a little tool to help me find accounts to unfollow... So when Supabase announced their launch week hackathon, I jumped right in and got hacking.

The code is not the cleanest, but it works, and I have already unfollowed a bunch of accounts - success 🎉
