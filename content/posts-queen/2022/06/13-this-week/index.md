This week marks the last unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt around the Gatsby islands for the season. It's going to be a good one. Grayson Hicks, Staff Software Engineer at Gatsby, join us to work on Gatsby Image CDN support for his plugin [gatsby-plugin-remote-images](https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images).

We'll be back in August!  
Help us improve by answering:

- What do you like best about the show?
- What don't you like about the show?
- Who would you like us to have on as a guest?
- What is a topic you would like to see covered?

If you, like us, could not make it to OG Deep Dive navigator Paul's meetup in San Fransisco, you may join [Tuesday's Gatsby webinar](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/achieving-performant-creativity-gatsby-rive/).

And last but not least, last week gave us [Gatsby v4.16](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.16/). I am exited by [Speed Improvements for Image Processing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.16/#speed-improvements-for-image-processing) ⏳
