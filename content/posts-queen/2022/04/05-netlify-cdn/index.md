The POW! web app is hosted on Netlify, and so is the [soon to be released](https://pow-site.netlify.com/) version of the marketing site.

However, after upgrading to the latest version of [@raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-source-youtube-oembed), with support for Gatsby ImageCDN, my sourced YouTube Thumbnails went blank...

Turns out support for Gatsby ImageCDN is not on by default; you need to set the environment variable `GATSBY_CLOUD_IMAGE_CDN` set to `true`.

After doing so and triggering a "Clear cache and deploy site," the YouTube Thumbnails came back, and all was good!
