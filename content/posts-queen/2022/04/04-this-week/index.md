Are you close to NY?  
I'd love to meet up for lunch on April 7th in NY.  
Let me know!

Last week gave us [Gatsby v4.11](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.11) with support for the newly released React&nbsp;18.

Let me know if you come over any good Gatsby React 18 content. I have not had time to look into this myself yet!

The Sanity Source Plugin got [ready for Gatsby ImageCDN](https://twitter.com/sellwood_jack/status/1508854860497575939?t=fgthDaQ48WQFmzId18zycQ&s=19).

If you need help getting your plugin ready, book a [call with Cap'n Ola and me](https://savvycal.com/raae/gatsby)!
