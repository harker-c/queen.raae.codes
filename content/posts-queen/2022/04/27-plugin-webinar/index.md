A Gatsby Webinar from October 2019 with Espen DalÃ¸kken from Sanity, Jason Lengstorf from Gatsby (now Netlify), and yours truly on the topic of [What Can Gatsby Plugins Do?](https://youtu.be/QIhrbJcqKu4?t=1633).

My presentation is on the what, why, and how of [gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-remark-oembed).

[![3 x first YouTube Clip](./screengrab-youtube.jpg)](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4SgRGe7v4mSck6wk25y3LHvEtHt4f_wR)

I also cover the year-long journey at that point, including waiting for a [sub-plugin cache bug](https://youtu.be/QIhrbJcqKu4?t=1975) to be fixed before releasing the first version.

Fast forward to today, and I am again struggling with a sub-plugin cache problem... More on that tomorrow!

All the best,
