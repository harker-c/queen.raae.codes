emojii: 🏝 🗓

After a super social summer and late summer, we are planning a week of quiet and calm. Ready to slow down a little for the fall season before heading out to meet people in November for [JamstackConf](https://jamstack.org/conf/) and [Modern Frontends](https://www.modernfrontends.live/).

Last week Gatsby released an [alpha version of Gatsby v5](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/alpha-v5). I, for one, am excited to see what is in store for this version!

Pirate [Arisa](https://twitter.com/arisa_dev/status/1565805126400499713) of Storyblok announced their reworked ultimate Gatsby series.

[![Woohoo🥳 I’m so happy to announce this series… Gataby & @storyblok ultimate tutorial series🎉 We reviewed the major framework tutorials and renewed into a bite-size series🧁 Let us know how you like it😎 P.S. great job, @patrickodey_ 😁](./twitter-storyblok-gatsby.png)](https://twitter.com/arisa_dev/status/1565805126400499713)

And this week is our last [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/UWVsibCXBFg) without a guest for a while. Let me know if you have any special requests!
