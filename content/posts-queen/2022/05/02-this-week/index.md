Last week's focus for me was the Gatsby Remark oEmbed Plugin. I fixed three tree-traversal bugs. Support for MDX is still a little up in the air, though, as the only possible solution at the moment will constitute a breaking change.

Last week also gave us a new Gatsby release: [v4.13](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.13/).

This week [Pierre de Wulf](https://twitter.com/PierreDeWulf) of [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/) joins us to create a plugin to source Crowdcast webinars into queen.raae.codes since Crowdcast lacks API. A must watch if you ask me&nbsp;🤪
