We had so much fun scraping Crowdcast with ScrapingBee last week that we'll continue with [scraping the cover images](https://youtu.be/vO26ZOGb6RY) into the Gatsby Content Layer as well on Thursday!

Also, on Thursday, you may join "friend of the pirates" Mike Gualtieri for a webinar on [scaling security](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/webinars/scaling-security-with-gatsby/). Interested in how to secure your Serverless Gatsby Function, check out Mike on [our Summar Functions 2021 webinar](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/securing-your-gatsby).

I am also excited to see what [Sage](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo), creator of Chakra UI, has been up to with his new framework [Zag](https://zagjs.com/): UI components powered by Finite State Machines on [Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/build-ui-components-with-state-machines).
