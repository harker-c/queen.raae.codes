Next time you start on a Gatsby Plugin, you might want to use our [Gatsby Plugin Starter](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter):

[![@raae HUGE thanks for your gatsby-plugin-starter! I just started a new plugin and breezed through A LOT of boilerplate thanks to you and could focus on getting my project started instead 🙏](./davidpaulsson-plugin-tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/davidpaulsson/status/1498660929482993669)

[![almost forgot thanks to @raae the Gatsby Plugin starter ... made the plugin blazingly fast to write, with full Semantic Release to NPM](./gatsby-plugin-starter-ash.png)](ttps://twitter.com/Ash_Hitchcock/status/1471048277747548163)

It sets you up for success with a yarn monorepo project with a folder for your plugin and a folder for your demo.

In addition, the plugin comes with automatic releases configured powered by [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) and GitHub Actions.

If you take it for a spin, let me know how it goes!

All the best,
