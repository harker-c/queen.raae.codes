Ola and I will be focusing on the Cloudinary Plugins this week. Let us know if you use either gatsby-source-cloudinary or gatsby-transformer-cloudinary. We could use some beta testers for our upgrades.

Last week Gatsby released the `Script` component as part of [v4.15](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.15/), making it easier to [add third-party/external](/2022-01-05-external-scripts/) or custom scripts.

I am hoping to make use of it in our gatsby-remark-oembed plugin. Maybe it should be the topic for this week's Deep Dive 🤔

OG Deep Dive navigator Paul is doing his first-ever talk this week. If you are in San Fransisco, come out for [Rise of the Robots](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/demos/rise-of-the-robots/).
