I signed up for Amy's inaugural [Two-Week Build Challenge](https://www.twoweekbuild.com/). And there is still time for you to sign up!

Let me know if you need some added accountability. We could set up co-working sessions 🎉

## How It Works

- Pick Something to Build
- Build it in 2 Weeks
- Ship it

## Rules and Guidelines

- Have fun.
- Don’t overthink it.
- Don’t start until March 1, 2024.
- You can build anything. Write an ebook. Design a UI library. Build a web application.
- At the end of 2 weeks, ship what you have.

I'm building a, Astro website for our podcast Data in the Wild launching in April now that all episodes of season 1 are recorded.

And I plan on [live streaming](https://youtube.com/QueenRaae/live) every day starting Monday, the 4th.

But if I fold or skip some, that is also okay...
