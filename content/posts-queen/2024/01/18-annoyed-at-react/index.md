Last week, Cassidy Williams wrote [Kind of annoyed at React](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/annoyed-at-react/), and I wholeheartedly agree with her train of thought.

In it, she mentioned that the latest [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v18.2.0) release was in June 2022 🤯

That made me peek at the release note again, reminding me that React Server Components (RSC) are still experimental.

And together with experiences like:

> Every time a new developer picked up our codebase, the questions came up: “What’s running on the server? What’s running on the client?” Every PR had feedback regarding something accidentally/unnecessarily shipped to the client.

mentioned in [​Everything I Wish I Knew before moving 50,000 lines of code to React Server Components​](https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components) it makes me cautious, very cautious.

But it's always a good idea to try to understand a concept, and for that, I recommend Josh Comeau's post [Making Sense of React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/).
