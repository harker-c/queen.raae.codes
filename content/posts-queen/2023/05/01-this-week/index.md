May is bank-holiday bonanza here in Norway, starting with today and International Workers' Day. We're hosting a BBQ, and the weather forecast is suddenly snow 😱

So expect my emails to be few and far between this month; I'll focus on getting out an edited video every other week together with the bi-weekly stream.

Let me know what you would like to see a video explain!

Tomorrow we're interviewing [Anthony Eden](https://www.youtube.com/live/MzXBmNJnLhc), founder of DNSimple, on Data in the Wild. He was a hoot to [interview for Slow & Steady](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y9p2IgX1Zzs), so I totes recommend you tune in.
