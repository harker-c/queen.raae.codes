title: Twitter announces 100 USD plan, but we still know next to nothing
brands: Twitter
projects: Prune your Follows

I spent most of yesterday trying not to look up the promised Twitter pricing so that I could react live on our [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://www.youtube.com/live/0YUvhEmHh_w).

However, there was not much to react to:

- Paid plan: 100 USD a month with
  - for low level of API usage (whatever that means)
  - max 1,500 tweets created per month
- Fee plan: there will still be one ðŸ¤ª

We still have no idea if Prune your Follows can run on the free plan. 100 USD a month is a lot to swing for a side project such as Prune your Follows if that is where we land.

Let's all cross our fingers that we'll be fine on the "new" free plan ðŸ¤ž

All the best,\
