You might have seen it from a mile away, but it took me a long time to embrace, accept, lean into, or whatever it was, that my ideal role in this industry is as a Developer Advocate 🥑

And just as I did, the opportunity of a lifetime came along. I am joining [Outseta](http://www.outseta.com?via=queen), the all-in-one membership software, as a fractional Developer Advocate.

I'll be earning a salary and equity per Outseta's [unique approach to compensation and ownership](https://www.outseta.com/posts/payment-structure).

Have you not always been in Developer Relations? You might ask.

Many folks assumed I worked for Gatsby in some Developer Relations capacity. I did not 😆

But we created Prune your Follows in public in partnership with Xata and are now producing a podcast for them. So you could say it's been written in the stars for a few months now, and accepting the position unlocked this memory for me:

[![September 2018, I finished the sentence: "In five years I'll be" with "a Developer Advocate" for my uni reunion. Then life, side projects, and becoming a Gatsby authority happened. But here we are four and a half years later, and I am Outseta's fractional Developer Advocate 🎉](./tweet_memory.png)](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1646417559967629313)

So while it hasn't felt intentional, who knows how these things fall into place 🤷‍♀️

All the best,\
