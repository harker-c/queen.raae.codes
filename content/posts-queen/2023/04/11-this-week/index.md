What a great vacation, after those initial days in the mountains, we enjoyed the city and hosted an Easter dinner full of neighbors 🥰

This morning we interviewed [Benedikt Deicke](https://twitter.com/benediktdeicke) for the Xata podcast [Data in the Wild](https://www.youtube.com/live/rnsU8kPM6wo). He is the co-founder of [Userlist](https://www.userlist.com/).
