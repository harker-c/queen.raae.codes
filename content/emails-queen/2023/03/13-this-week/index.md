After a slow week of listening to a bunch of podcasts, I am ready to get my coding on this week 👩‍💻 I still need to be mindful of the concussion, though, so I postponed some scheduled streams to ensure I don't overdo it.

Tomorrow is the first Data in the Wild recording, a podcast we are doing for Xata. It would mean a lot to us if you [show up in the chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/mukKhU3XXZU).

I certainly look forward to learning from [Monica Lent](https://twitter.com/monicalent) experience data modeling "User Roles and Permission"!
