title: Is 5 unfollows in 15 minutes enough?

So, Twitter finally dropped their new API pricing ðŸ’£

- Free $0 / mo
- Basic $100 / mo
- Enterprise $42,000 / mo

Free does not give us access to who a user follows, so Prune your Follows would need the Basic-tier. We can find a way to cover the $100, but Basic only lets us facilitate five unfollows per 15 minutes per user. That is 10% of the current limit of 50 unfollows per 15 minutes per user.

So my question to you is; would Prune you Follows still be helpful?
