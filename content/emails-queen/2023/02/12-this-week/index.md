title: The Twitter saga continues 🤪 And this week around the Gatsby islands
---

It's Monday, and we still don't know if Prune your Follows will work with the new Twitter API free plan or the new Twitter API paid plan 🤪 Get your pruning in today if you've postponed it!

Gatsby v5.6.0 is out, and [Head API supports context providers from `wrapRootElement`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.6/#head-api-supports-context-providers-from-wraprootelement).

Have you seen the React Documentary?
I hear it's really good; hoping to catch it this week!

![I'll be watching the new Your Place or Mine tonight with my rom-com sister-in-crime. But I'll be secretly wishing I could swap it for the React documentary 🤓](./twitter-react-documentary.jpg)
