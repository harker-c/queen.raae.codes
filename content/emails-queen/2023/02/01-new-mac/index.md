This month I'll be setting up two new macs ðŸ¤¯

I am waiting for my very own Macbook Air Starlight M2 and have been given a pretty sweet Macbook Pro by a client.

It's been years, 7.5 in fact, since I last set up a new mac ðŸ‘µ So naturally, I reached out on Twitter.

[@chris_sev](https://twitter.com/chris__sev/status/1620932751322144769) has a script you can copy and tweak, and [@ceceliacreates](https://twitter.com/ceceliacreates/status/1620790705781198853) wrote up her process with handy verification instructions for each step.

Do you have a favorite go-to guide?\
Or do you yolo it every time?

All the best,\
