title: Homebrew, it's like npm for your Mac
---

Did you know you can install Spotify, 1Password, Slack, and other obscure techy dev stuff with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)? 

I did not until looking closer at this [Mac setup script](https://gist.github.com/chris-sev/45a92f4356eaf4d68519d396ef42dd99) by [@chris_sev](https://twitter.com/chris__sev/status/1620932751322144769) on our [unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt](https://www.youtube.com/live/rLmJgo7g_N4) setting up my new MacBook Air.

It's usually pretty straightforward to guess the "cask" name. 

Descript is `descript`:

```bash
brew install descript
```

1Password is `1password`:

```bash
brew install 1password
```

But VSCode is `visual-studio-code`:

```bash
brew install visual-studio-code`
```

Using Homebrew saves you so much time! You no longer need to find the download button on each site, wait for the download, and then drag the icon to the Applications folder. Fire and forget!
