Just when I think the darkness of winter will never end, it does. The last couple of days has been nothing but blue skies. It's light in the morning, and the sun comes high enough to fill my office corner with light. Yesterday I even caught Tilly chillaxing in the sunny corner of her cage.

If you have no idea who Tilly is, join the treasure hunt Thursday and check out the new addition Tilly&Milly Cam.
