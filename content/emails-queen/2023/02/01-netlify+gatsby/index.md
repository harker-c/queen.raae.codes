**Breaking news:** Netlify Acquires Gatsby ðŸ¤¯

![We're thrilled to announce that we have acquired Gatsby Inc.! Together we will build the future of composable, and empower developers with flexibility and choice in building composable web experiences.](./twitter.com_Netlify.jpg)

The funny thing is I talked about JavaScript framework business models with pirate @tujoworker when meeting him in real life earlier in the day.

![Wow, and I just talked today with @raae about JavaScript framework business models âœ¨](./twitter.com_raae.jpg)

It seems to me they are betting on Valhalla. Still, they also promise to be "good stewards of the Gatsby open-source project and the maintainers will join the open source group together with the creators of frameworks like Solid JS and Eleventy."

Time will tell!

All the best,\
