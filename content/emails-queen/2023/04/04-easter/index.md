title: Happy Easter the Norwegian way 🐣

I'm a conflicted Norwegian every easter. One part of me wants to head to the mountains with "everyone else," and another simply wants to enjoy a silent and eerie Oslo.

Turns out it's not an either-or conundrum!

We got to spend the first weekend of this easter holiday at a friend's cabin, while we'll spend the rest of the week back home in Oslo. Hoping to make it a tradition.

Sometimes you ask, and the universe answers, or maybe you just got clear on what you wanted and made it happen 🤪

As with every school holiday, no content outside this email. Therefore no schedule!

Does your country celebrate easter?

All the best,\
