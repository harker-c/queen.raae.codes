title: Make sure to check your open graph (social sharing) data
---

It's easy to forget to ensure that the open graph data, i.e. the content you see when sharing a site on social media, is correct. Wrong meta tags might not be "visible" for days since Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. heavily cache this data!

Luckily they all have tools to check if it's all correct without you having to make an actual post. These tools also help force the service in question to bust its cache, grabbing the data from the latest version of your site.

- [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/https:%2F%2Fqueen.raae.codes)
- [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen.raae.codes)
  - Hit the "scrape again" to bust the cache
- [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
  - No longer shows a preview, but will bust the cache (we think)

Another quick way to ensure it's all correct is using the [Social Share Preview](https://socialsharepreview.com/browser-extensions) Chrome Extension. It will not bust any caches, so make sure to head over to the tools above when you are done with your changes.
