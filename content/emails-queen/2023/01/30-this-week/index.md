title: We're creating a new podcast üë©‚Äçüíª And this week around the Gatsby islands
tags: Gatsby Head API

In March, we'll start recording a new podcast (for [Xata](https://xata.io/)) digging into data modeling successes and failures. We hope to give you a jump start on your next project by building on others' experience getting their data model right.

**Who should we interview?**

Last week gave us a new version of Gatsby, v5.5.0, with it a way to set `html` and `body` attributes using [the Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.5/#setting-html-and-body-attributes).

## Our weekly Treasure Hunt

We'll be heading to our good friend's [gallery opening](https://www.golsa.no/exhibitions/47-too-long-at-the-fair-fredrik-berberg-lena-christakis-olivia-drusin-nick-farhi/), so no stream this week!
