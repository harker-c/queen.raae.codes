It's 2023. Are you ready?

The Pirate Princess most definitely is ✨

I started the year [by creating a Discord bot](https://github.com/queen-raae/yoga-pirates-bot). The bot lets the Yoga Pirates track their days on the mat in 2023 🧘‍♀️🧘🏽‍♂️ If you'd like to **join our little yoga accountability group**, let me know!

Discord always makes me feel like I'm this guy 👇

But I am doing my best to embrace the platform 🤪

[Prune your follows](https://pruneyourfollows.com/) did well over the break with an [article in Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/28/this-tool-helps-you-trim-your-follow-list-on-twitter/), crossing 10.0000 unfollows facilitated and being blocked by Twitter more than I'd like to admit 🤯
