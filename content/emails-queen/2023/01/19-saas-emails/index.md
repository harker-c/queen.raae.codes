"What do I email my SaaS users?" is a question you should probably be asking a little earlier in your journey than I did. No email has yet been sent to Prune your Follows users ðŸ˜¬

You could probably ask ChatGPT, but I am getting "at capacity" messages right now. Also, I still believe in a little human touch.

But if you, like me, still need some help getting started with your SaaS lifecycle emails, check out Userlist's [Full-Text Campaign Templates](https://userlist.com/docs/campaign-templates/).

No more staring at a blank ~piece of paper~ screen ðŸ’ª

They got templates for:

- Basic Onboarding
- Upgrade to Paid
- Newly Upgraded
- Switch to Annual Billing
- Ask for a Review
- Offer Support Proactively
- NPS Survey
- Upcoming Payment
- Failed Payment Recovery
- Cancellation Survey

I'll use the "Basic Onboarding" and "Ask for a Review" myself in the coming weeks as we set up campaigns for Prune your Follows.

All the best,\
