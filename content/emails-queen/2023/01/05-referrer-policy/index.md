title: Have you checked your Referrer-Policy?
---

[Prune your follows](https://pruneyourfollows.com) initial build was sponsored by Xata. As part of the agreement, the site has a "powered by Xata" notice on every page linking to [xata.io](https://xata.io/), in addition to a link to my site.

Looking at my our analytics, I found it weird that no one was clicking through from [pruneyourfollows.com](https://pruneyourfollows.com/) to [queen.raae.codes](https://queen.raae.codes/) or vice versa.

As I imagine tracking traffic from PYF is part of Xata's evaluation of our collab, I got a little worried üò¨

Turns out the default Referrer-Policy is `same-origin` for Gatsby Cloud, Netlify, and probably most other similar platforms.

> `same-origin`: Send the origin, path, and query string for same-origin requests. Don't send the Referer header for cross-origin requests.
> <cite>[mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)</cite>

The only referrals tracked on for example, queen.raae.codes, were from itself to itself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

After reading [Referer and Referrer-Policy best practices](https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices) from web.dev I landed on using `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

It will send along the origin (`https://pruneyourfollows.com`) but not the full URL (`https://pruneyourfollows.com/app?example=possible-secret`).

## How to set the Referrer-Policy on Gatsby Cloud

To make `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` the policy across the board configure the `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud` like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        headers: {
          "/*": ["Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

And voila, I finally saw referrer information from [pruneyourfollows.com](https://pruneyourfollows.com/) to [queen.raae.codes](https://queen.raae.codes/) and vice versa.

All the best,\

PS. Since we do not have access to Xata's analytics, we would also like to track clicks on their link on our side, and we'll do that on tonight's treasure hunt [Track outgoing links with Fathom for Prune your follows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SftxLYjW_ZQ).
