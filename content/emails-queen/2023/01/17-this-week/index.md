title: Me, a content creator? And this week around the Gatsby islands
---

Even after streaming, podcasting and writing almost daily, I have not seen myself as a "content creator." But I guess that is part of who I am, maybe even a large part and truth be told, a part of my day-to-day I find exciting, creative and fun 🎉

The new year even started with closing a deal to produce three videos for Xata. So I guess it's time to embrace it and make 2023 the year I come out as a content creator. It might not come as a surprise to you, though 🤷‍♀️

We'll keep leaning into audio and video, so let me know if your company could benefit from some joyful videos or a podcast season tailored to your dev audience!
