title: Byte-sized emails about Semantic HTML Elements this advent?
projects: Semantic Advent
---

Semantic HTML Elements are a foundational piece of the World Wide Web.

However, the popularity [A little semantic HTML trick for React components](https://queen.raae.codes/emails/2022-10-10-semantic-react/) and doing Gatsby code reviews have shown me that this is a topic that many developers need to brush up on.

Myself included!

There are quite a few new (and some deprecated) elements since the last time I did any intentional research on the topic.

So, this advent, I will share byte-sized emails on a new Semantic HTML Element each day in December until Christmas. The first element out is `<fieldset>`. Read it over on [advent.raae.codes](https://advent.raae.codes/2023-12-01-fieldset/), and be sure to sign up for the next ones.
