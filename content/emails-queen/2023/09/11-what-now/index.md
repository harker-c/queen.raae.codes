We are, of course, hoping Gatsby gets a second wind, but as a content creator, it seems Gatsby will not get the piratical family and me anywhere these days ðŸ˜¬

So my question to you is:

> Would you like to learn a new Jamstack framework with us, and if so, which one: Astro, Remix, or Eleventy?

Or is there something else entirely you would like to see from us?

All the best,
Raae

PS: Remember to move your Gatsby Cloud sites within the next month(ish).
