Yesterday I got to meet long-term internet friend Monica Lent, of Blogging for devs fame. If you haven't [signed up for her free email course](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) yet, you are in for a treat.

Hopefully, I get to meet many more internet friends IRL before the year ends as I'llI'll be speaking at the [Jamstack Conf](https://jamstack.org/conf/) in San Fransisco and then at [Modern Frontends](https://www.modernfrontends.live/) in London 🎉

Gatsby is hyping the Data Layer these days. Coincidently my favorite part of Gatsby, so I am all for that. I am eager to get my hands on _Runtime GraphQL_ for instance.

> Runtime GraphQL. By far the most requested feature for the data layer! Soon you'll be able to query GraphQL — not just at build time — but from functions and during SSR.

Read Kyle Mathews [blog post for more Data Layer goodies](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/scaling-rsg-builds-with-gatsbys-data-layer/).

There have been five minor Gatsby releases while I've enjoyed the summer 🤯 Check out the [release log](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/releases) to get up to speed. But here are some of my favs:

- [`gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.21/#gatsby-plugin-mdx-v4)
- [Gatsby Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.19/#gatsby-head-api) - Better performance & more future-proof than `react-helmet`
- [Server Side Rendering (SSR) in development](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.18/#server-side-rendering-ssr-in-development)
