**Happy news:** [Xata](https://xata.io/?utm_campaign=prune&utm_source=email&utm_medium=this-week) is sponsoring us to work on Prune your Follows, meaning we get to make it better and give it a proper launch in early November 🥳

So for this week's unauthorized and rum-fueled [treasure hunt](https://youtu.be/Xr-s0Hg_45w) in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands, we'll be working on Prune your Follows using Xata, NextAuth, and Gatsby of course.

**Small news:** This weekend, my sister and I closed up the summer cabin, already looking forward to easter when we'll be back to paint the boat house 👩‍🎨

**Gatsby news:** Last week, Gatsby released the v5 Beta. It requires React v18 and Node v18; kinda funny those two are the same version 🤪 To get started, look at [Migrating from v4 to v5](https://v5.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/).

I would love to hear how you get on. I use node-canvas to generate open graph images, and somehow it does not support Node v18 yet, so no upgrading for me 😢 But I guess I could upgrade Prune your Follows 🤔
