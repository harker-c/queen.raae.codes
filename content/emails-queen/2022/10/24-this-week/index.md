It's two weeks to JamstackConf!  
Is my talk ready? NO  
Will it be ready? YES

I have some discount codes; let me know if you want one!

My Macbook is getting old; lately, the battery has gone from bad to worse. Then the trackpad stopped working correctly. So to make sure it does not die, on stage, I took it to the iHospital, and now it no longer has a swollen battery 🥳
