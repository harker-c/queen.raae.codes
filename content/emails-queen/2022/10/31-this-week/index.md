I held out for the longest time on two things: Halloween and Tailwind...

[![Two things it seems I'll fully embrace by this time next year: Tailwind 🧰
and Halloween 🎃](./Halloween-Tailwind-Tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/raae/status/1586712286827511809)

And little did I know these two things are, in fact, connected 🤯

[![🥳 Big milestone today — Tailwind CSS turns 5 years old! We released the very first version of Tailwind CSS on Halloween night in 2017 👻 (Special thanks to @mattwalerdotcom for this amazingly relevant photo 🎃](./Halloween-Tailwind-Tweet-2.jpg)](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1587128677724291074)

Where are you with these two?
