Ever wanted to make one of those explainer videos with text overlay?

Descript makes it so easy you might get sick of me posting videos to Twitter ðŸ¤ª

Descript transcribes your videos. Then you may use the transcription as your text overlay like I have added above my head in the example above.

But even cooler! You can edit the video by editing the transcription. It makes it much easier to remove parts and rearrange your sentences.

I found that very beneficial when creating clips of me answering questions on the stream. It seems I often start with some background and then arrive at my answer. However, the other way around works much better for the short clip version.
