Happy first week of advent 🕯<span style="opacity: 0.4">🕯🕯🕯</span>

This week is about improving [pruneyourfollows.com](https://pruneyourfollows.com/) and wrapping up our work on the Cloudinary plugins with reworked documentation 📝

&nbsp;

Gatsby released [v5.1.0](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.1/) last week.

I still haven't had time to play with Partial Hydration, but we did play with slices on steam. I even clipped what we did into a shorter video:

- [How to use the Gatsby v5 Slices API with Josh](https://youtu.be/mLXJ6dXXwww).

What am I even talking about?

- [Slices API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-slice/) unlocks up to 90% reduction in build duration for content changes in highly shared components
- [Partial Hydration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/partial-hydration/) allows you to ship only the necessary JavaScript to the browser
