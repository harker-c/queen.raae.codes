It snowed in Oslo today, reminding me to remind you to make sure [@raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow) is installed on you Gatsby site ready for the season.

If you do, the default configuration will make it start to snow on December 1st.

All the best,
