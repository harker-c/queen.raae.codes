title: This week around the Gatsby islands
emojii: 🏝 🗓

We are excited to be doing some more work on Cloudinary's Gatsby Plugins this fall, and on Thursday, legendary [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock) of Space Jelly (and Cloudinary) will be joining the unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunts in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands.

Thinking about JamstackConf? I have two 50% off coupons, let me know if you want one!

And on that note, should I wear my national costume for my talk?

In less self absorbent news:

Gatsby released v4.23 last week with some bugfixes, but also a [Request for Comments (RFC)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.23/#open-rfcs) on the `Slices` API that makes rebuilds happen on a component level.

In addition, v5 is in the works 🎉

Check out the [Umbrella Discussion on all things v5](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609) on GitHub and the [Partial Hydration demo by Ward Peters](https://twitter.com/khaled_garbaya/status/1570048904758022148) on YouTube via Twitter. We need to get Ward Peters back on the show because this is game-changing 🤯
