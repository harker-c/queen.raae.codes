Happy forth and last week of advent ðŸ•¯ðŸ•¯ðŸ•¯ðŸ•¯

Last week we launched Prune your Follows!\
It was a blast, we broke the internet (kind of), and I'll tell you more about it tomorrow.

While the Pirate Princess is out of school (Thursday 22nd to January 2nd), we'll take a break from all regularly scheduled content. The streams might even wait another couple of weeks to get started in the new year. We have five family birthdays in 5 weeks, including mine ðŸ¤¯

In 2023 would you like more of the following:

- "follow along as we build a real app" content,
- "this is how things are done in Gatsby" content
- or something else, maybe?

[Gatsby 5.3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.3/) came out five days ago, giving us [ES Modules (ESM) in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.3/#es-modules-esm-in-gatsby-files) files. Finally ðŸŽ‰
