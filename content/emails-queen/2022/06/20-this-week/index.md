We are finishing up the major work on the Gatsby Cloudinary plugins 🎉 If you are using Gatsby + Cloudinary, we could really need some help testing them on real projects! LMK, if that could be you 🙏

This week is [React Norway](https://reactnorway.com/). We'll get to hang out with our contact at Cloudinary and other awesome peeps as a gentle introduction to workcation 2020!

No streams or regular content until late August, but we'll follow up with our clients and maybe do some recreational coding. It depends on how much rain we get, I suppose ☔️

I do love a good workcation, as you can see in [this vlog from 2020](https://youtu.be/fpFY82efGPI) ☀️

Let's hang if you find yourself on the west coast of Sweden in July or in Oslo in August. Send me a DM on Twitter, and we'll figure it out.
