Last month Benedikt and I [interviewed Pierre de Wulf](https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/episodes/140_draft), co-founder of Scraping Bee, for the Slow&Steady podcast.

So if you watched our [Source content from anywhere with ScrapingBee](https://queen.raae.codes/emails/2022-05-06-scrapingbee/) unauthorized and rum-fueled treasure hunt in the sharky waters around the Gatsby islands and thought to yourself: "I would like to hear more from that dude Pierre?" It's your lucky day.

If not, [give it a listen anyway](https://www.slowandsteadypodcast.com/episodes/140_draft). It's an interesting story about creating a tool for developers and bootstrapping it to $1m ARR with a team of three 🎉

All the best,
