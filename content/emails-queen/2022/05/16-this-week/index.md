Last week's release from Gatsby was a fun one, [v4.14](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/):

- [Experimental: GraphQL Typgen](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#experimental-graphql-typegen)
- [Improvements in Image and Font Loading Times](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#improvements-in-image-and-font-loading-times)
- [Gatsby Functions Body Parsing Configuration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#gatsby-functions-body-parsing-configuration)
- [`gatsby-source-drupal`: Image CDN Support](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#gatsby-source-drupal-image-cdn-support)
- [Updated Default Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#updated-default-starter)

I am especially excited about being able to use the raw body sent to a Gatsby Serverless Functions. Stripe and others require it to verify if the request is valid!

The GraphQL Typegen also seems super interesting:

This week we'll make sure our gatsby-source-youtube-oEmbed plays nicely with both Gatsby ImageCDN and downloading the thumbnails as local files.

Also worth noting that next week Sanity is putting on what seems to be an excellent [conference on Structured Content](https://structuredcontent.live/). We'll be attending the Oslo watch party!
