## Is your dev-brain sick of dev-tasks that don't stick?

Are you unsure of which dev-tasks will stick in your dev-brain? Don't you know how to practice a dev-task you'll need to do again later? Are you practicing dev-tasks for hours, but feel like you might be wasting a lot of time? Do you feel your practice techniques are unpiraty or even weak?

## Imagine your dev-task nailed into your dev-brain

**Imagine this** â€“ Imagine knowing your dev-task will STAY nailed down inside your dev-brain until you need to do it again. Imagine knowing exactly how to prepare your dev-task to practice it so you'll be able to do it again 96% reliably. Imagine practicing dev-tasks the same number of hours, but KNOWING you're not wasting a minute? Imagine using ONE piraty prepare technique to nail down dev-tasks into your dev-brain.
