## Imagine a never-ending pipeline of content

Imagine this â€“ All you need to do is show up and talk about what you know best: your Dev Tool! With a person who has 30 years of experience sailing the World Wide Web by your side!

No more worrying about what to post on social media. No more worrying about what to write in your newsletter. No more ifs, buts, or maybes. Just show up and enjoy the ride!

Imagine having our team transform that biweekly commitment into a never-ending pipeline of content to share with your audience.

Close that "I should do some marketing" loop in your mind and get back to what you do best: building your Dev Tool!

## Here's How It Works

We start with an exploratory call. We'll talk about your Dev Tool, your audience, and your goals. We'll also workshop the concept for your live streams: office hours, live coding, product update chats or a combination of these.

After the exploratory call, you choose your package, and we'll get to work refining the concept and producing the marketing material needed: templates for social media, thumbnails, clips etc. You may be as involved as you want to be in this process, or completely hands-off!

Then all you need to do is show up for the scheduled streams every other week. Don't worry, we know you are busy so we'll send you reminders and there is no need to prepare ahead of time. We'll spend 15 minutes before going live to get you ready and comfortable.

Between the streams, we'll fill your content pipeline with clips, quotes, and other marketing material depending on the package chosen. Again you may be completely hands-off, or review every draft before it goes out.

## Packages

We offer three packages: Basic, Premium, and Royal.

### Basic

Go live with Queen Raae and get 4 vertical clips per stream to share on social media. You'll also get access to the full recording for additional content creation.

### Premium

Everything in the basic package plus an additional 3 posts of non video content based on the stream, this could be quotes, images, or other marketing material. In total 7 posts per stream generated or in other words a post every other day. The content will be tailored to one social media platform of your choice.

### Royal

Everything in the premium package plus another 7 content pieces based on the stream. In total 14 posts per stream, or in other words one post per day.

In this package, you may also choose to have the content tailored for two additional social media platforms.
