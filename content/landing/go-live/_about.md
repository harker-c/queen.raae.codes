## Why me?

I love live streaming, it energizes me and will make you relax and be the human you are. Not the robot that often comes out if you were to preparpe a presentation.

- Experiemented with live streaming since 2018,
- and since 2020 I have been live streaming regularly on YouTube: 150+ streams and counting.
- Co-hosted the Slow&Steady podcast since 2021 where we've interviewed guests about their journey as founders in addition to the more regular chatting about work and life episodes.

I am also an engineer, so I'll get what you are talking about or at least be able to ask the right questions:

- Coding since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- Hold a Master of Computer Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
- Enjoy figuring out how to get the most of the tools and technologies, and share it with others.
- Created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
