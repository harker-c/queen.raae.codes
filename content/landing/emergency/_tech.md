I can help you with most things web (dev) related:

- **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** has been my bread and butter for years.
- **JAMstack** and serverless architecture are in my vocabulary.
- I'm a **Gatsby** expert, but loving digging into **Astro** at the moment.
- **React** is my go to client side library, but I have some experience with Angular and Vue.
- I started my web journey with **WordPress**, and can uasually figure out how to make it do what you want.
- The same is true for **Squarespace**, **Carrd**, **Framer**, **Wix**, and other website builders.
- Connecting services with **Zapier** or **Make** is in my wheelhouse.
- Problems with emails? I have experience with **Convertkit**, **Mailchimp** and the like.

And a whole lot more, if you are unsure [book a call](https://savvycal.com/raae/emergency) and I'll cancel + refund if it's not my jam.

If it's Webflow or Next though, I'm not your gal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
