## Why me?

- I have been coding since 1995 and have been stuck on my fair share of reefs by now.
- I hold a Master of Computer Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
- I enjoy figuring out how to get the most of the tools and technologies, and share it with others.
- I have created apps trusted by the Swedish Armed Forces, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and others.
