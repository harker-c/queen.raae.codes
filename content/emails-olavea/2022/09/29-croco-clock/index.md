title: could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?
---

Ahoy, skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

In my last letter, we looked into [Don't let Distraction Diaz distract you](/emails/2022-09-29-automate/). So today, I'll show you my favorite focus tool to determine when your sub-task practice session is done. It's my great-grandfather Captain Crook's croco clock. 🐊 ⏲️ We'll look at:

What a croco-clock is,
Why it can help you focus and
How you use it.

## WHAT is a croco-clock 🐊 ⏲️ ?

A croco-clock 🐊 can be an egg clock ⏲️ that goes ARRR! when your sub-task practice session is done.

Then you can stop

## WHY could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?

Firstly you decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain. This is good for your focus.

Secondly, by starting your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ you confirm to yourself your decision to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain

Thirdly, the clock is literally ticking, and you know you have this ONE practice session to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain.

## HOW do you use your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ ?

1. You set your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ to for example, 96 minutes
2. And place it in another room, especially if you are using your cellphone
3. You do your sub-task in exactly the same way again and again
4. Keep doing your sub-task again and again until your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ goes ARRR! even past the point, you feel you are already doing your sub-task 96%-reliably
5. Because you're a practice pirate and this sub-task will be YOUR treasure only when you have it automated into your dev-brain

Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺

## Your TODO

Write up a sentence about your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ experiments and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me; that would help us a lot!

🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep practicing!
