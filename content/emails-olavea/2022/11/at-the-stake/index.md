title: Mor-dred is coming!
---

Ahoy skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

👋😸🏴‍☠️

Here is more of the backstory of my plugin workbook


«So what?! When did anybody take that laughably un-funny clown Mor-dred seriously anyway?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Queen Mary took Mor-dred seriously yesterday.» Says Merlina.

«Yeah last night Mary burned an actress at the stake.» Says Lizabeth.

«Burned based on some REAL thin "evidence" Mor-dred showed bloody Mary of Jamstackian witchcraft.» Says Merlina.

Write up a sentence about your idea for your backstory and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!
