«Oh no! Not another fire?» Says Lizabeth.

«No, worse. My source suspects it's one more of those peculiar pet-kidnappings.» Says Merlina.

«Your sources keep giving us useless tip after useless tip.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No useless-on-it's-own is not the same as useless.» Says Merlina.

«Really?!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«And since day ONE I've been trying to get you two to practice a useless-on-it's-own sub-task.» Says Merlina.

## TODO

Write up a sentence about your idea for your backstory and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!

 🏴‍☠️😺👍

ARR!

Stay piraty 🏴‍☠️😺👍 and keep skill-builing!
